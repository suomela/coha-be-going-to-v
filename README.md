# BE going to V in COHA

This repository contains the data file that was used in the following study:

> Tanja Säily, Florent Perek, And Jukka Suomela (2025): Variation and change in the productivity of BE going to V in the Corpus of Historical American English, 1810–2009

The data file is otherwise complete, except that gender metadata is missing, as we do not have permission for releasing this part of the data set.

The file is in a format that can be directly opened in the [types3](https://github.com/suomela/types3) tool, as follows:

    ./types3-ui coha-be-going-to-v.json
